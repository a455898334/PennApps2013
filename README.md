Application Idea
----------------

Visiting somewhere away from home, or just want to meet new people? Use this app and connect with facebook to do just that. Find other people using the app close to you that you have mutual friends with. Figure out your common likes and plan a meeting together.


Things We Need
-------------
-Facebook login authentication stuff python api
-Given two user IDs, get list of mutual friends w that person. If permissions don't allow it, make sure this is properly stated
-Pretty frontpage
-Access through GPS or WiFi the location of the user (with permission - ask for it if it is not already given)
-Store the location information (FB ID + coordinates) in a database (AWS most likely)
-Deploy on AWS
